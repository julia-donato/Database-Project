# DriveTexas

DriveTexas is a web application designed to track and report traffic accidents. The application allows users in Texas to assess the safety of their routes based on historical accident data and report new incidents.

## How it Works

Users input their start and end locations along with the time of day and current weather conditions. The application then retrieves historical accident data for the proposed route. Users can also report new incidents by submitting details such as location, severity, weather condition, and a description of the accident.

2. **Accident Reporting**: Provide a means for users to report new incidents.
